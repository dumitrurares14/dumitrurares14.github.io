Custom tech engine project that ended up with an RTS game during Block D in Year 2 at BUAS. The engine is made in C++ and DirectX12 with hardware accelerated ray traced shadows using DXR. Worked on the material system, grass system, particle system, procedural sky and post processing effects tools and editor for all the systems mentioned.
