Stretch goal explored by me during the OpenGL voxel team project. I presented the explored technique at GPC 2024 with a small talk. Cellular automata is used for direct light propagation and cone tracing for indirect calculation and direct sampling. Volumetric and specular reflections are done also with cone tracing.


## Goals and Motivations
